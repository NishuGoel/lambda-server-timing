## Lambda Server-Timing Middleware

Enables Lambdas to return responses with Server-Timing Header allowing to to pass request-specific timings from the backend to the browser.

Enables a server to communicate performance metrics about the request-response cycle to the user agent. It also standardizes a JavaScript interface to enable applications to collect, process, and act on these metrics to optimize application delivery.
